# Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar app that allows you to schedule your workday and manage your tasks efficiently. With features like color-coding, local storage, and real-time time tracking, it helps you stay organized and productive throughout the day.

## Features

Current Day Display: The app displays the current day at the top of the calendar when you open it, so you always know what day it is.
Time Blocks: Time blocks are presented for standard business hours (9 AM - 5 PM) when you scroll down. Each time block represents an hour of your workday.
Color-Coding: Time blocks are color-coded based on past, present, and future time. The current hour is highlighted in a different color to help you identify where you are in your day.
Task Scheduling: You can enter tasks and events by clicking on a time block and typing in the description. These tasks are saved locally in your browser's storage.
Local Storage: The app saves your scheduled tasks in local storage. This means your tasks persist between page refreshes, and you won't lose your schedule even if you close the app.
